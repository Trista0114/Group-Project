    "title": "Green Spaces and Real Estate: Exploring the Influence of Environmental Factors on Housing Prices in Busan",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Generate by ChatGPT\n\n\n\n1 Background\nIn recent years, there has been a growing awareness of the benefits of living near environmental amenities, as more research uncovers the impact of neighborhood environments on both physical and mental health[1][2][3][4].\nStudies have shown that factors such as local built environment, proximity to environmental and built amenities and neighbourhood demographics, can significantly influence well-being. Specifically, residing near green spaces has been found to have a positive effect on mental health and encourages physical activity. Correspondingly, some studies have also found that environmental amenities could play a key role in influencing property prices [4], with growing recognition of the importance of green spaces. In Korea for instance, there is a gradual shift towards preference for residential areas near green spaces [5]. However, few studies have examined the relationship between proximity to green amenities and housing prices in Korea. \n\n\n2 Objectives\nThe primary objective of this project is to investigate how various factors, with a greater focus on the environmental amenities and the built environment factors, influences property prices in Korea. The project seeks to understand whether properties located closer to green spaces and other amenities tend to have higher market values. The secondary objective is to explore the interaction between green amenities, the built environment, and other factors, such as neighborhood demographics and seasonality, in shaping property prices.\nThe results from this project will help us gain insight on the factors driving property values in urban settings. As urbanization continues, the demand for green spaces and well-planned environments will likely increase. Understanding the connection between environmental amenities and local built environment and property prices could aid in creating more sustainable and livable urban areas, by offering insights for policymakers, estate developers and urban planners to make data-driven decisions on developing the city’s infrastructure and green spaces.\n\n\n3 Dataset\nTo achieve our objectives, we obtained a dataset used in a research paper to investigate variables influencing property prices in Korea. The dataset comprises of comprehensive information on the property prices in the Busan Metropolitan City of South Korea for transactions in 2018 to 2019 and various factors that influence property prices including characteristics of the property, distance to environmental amenities and local built environments, local demographic characteristics, and season in which the transaction occurred. \n\n\n4 Methodology & Approach\nWe will analyse and visualise the relationships between different factors and the housing prices in Busan by creating interactive R shiny applications.  Users will also be able to analyse the data based on their interests and draw their own insights and conclusions regarding the housing prices in Busan.\nWe will create 4 sub-modules to enable univariate analyses, bivariate analyses and multivariate analyses.\n\n\n5 Prototype Sketches\nThe following sketches were drawn to conceptualise our thoughts and discussions on the layout of the Shiny app along with its various functions. \n\n5.1 Univariate Analysis5.2 Bivariate Analysis5.3 Multivariate Analysis\n\n\nIn this sub-module, we aim to provide tools for analyzing individual variables. The interface includes summary statistics (mean, median, min, max, standard deviation), controls for variable selection and filtering, and a distribution visualization combining boxplot and half eye plot to display the selected variable’s characteristics. \n\n\n\nThis sub-module provides tools for examining relationships between pairs of variables. The interface features a correlation heatmap on the left showing strength of relationships between multiple variables, and a scatterplot on the right displaying the relationship between two selected variables. Controls allow users to select which continuous variables to include in the analysis for both visualization methods. \n\n\n\nThis panel offers tools for analyzing multiple variables simultaneously. It includes controls for selecting variables for clustering analysis, a dendrogram visualization showing hierarchical clustering results, and a parallel coordinate plot displaying relationships across multiple dimensions. \n\nThis panel provides radar plot functionality for multivariate visualization. Controls allow users to select encoded continuous variables and filter by a categorical variable. The radar plot displays multiple dimensions simultaneously with different colors representing different categories.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6 R packages\nThe R packages we will be using for the project include: \n\nTidyverse for manipulating the data \n\n\n\nggstatplot for visualising statistcal analysis \n\n\n\nGGally / ggpcp / ggparallel for creating parallel coordinate plot \n\n\n\nggdist for visualising distributions\n\n\n\ncorrplot for correlation heatmap \n\n\n\nGgESDA / ggradar / fmsb for radar chart \n\n\n\n7 Project Timeline\n\n\n\n8 Reference\n[1]Yim, D.

    "text": "Agenda Item 1: Project Modules & Shiny app Task allocations\nFollowing Prof’s feedback on our proposal, the team decided to re-consider the modules to be created for the project. Prof recommended the team to split the modules according to (1) EDA & CDA, (2) Explanatory Modelling and (3) Predictive Modelling.  \nJia Rong said that the modules the team has previously proposed are all on EDA & CDA. Hence the team should select a few of the previous ideas and work on it as 1 module for EDA & CDA. For example, the team could do the boxplot and smoothed histogram for EDA, the scatterplot and the correlation heatmap as CDA. In addition, boxplot for ANOVA can be added for CDA. \nFor explanatory modelling, Jia Rong suggested doing multiple linear regression and perhaps latent class analysis, with reference to senior’s work. As for predictive modelling, Jia Rong suggested trying out random forest and decision tree. \nPeng-Wei suggested that for the random forest part, we can provide an interactive adjustment interface for parameters (such as the number of trees , the number of variables), and instantly displays the model’s prediction performance (such as Accuracy, RMSE, MAE, etc.) in the Shiny app. As for the decision Tree, we can make user adjust parameters such as tree depth and splitting method on the interface, and displaying auxiliary analysis charts such as predicted vs. actual values, residual plots, etc. \nXiao Han suggested using tidyverse, car, and lmtest packages for multiple linear regression analysis with ggplot2 for regression diagnostic plots, while implementing poLCA, mclust, and flexmix packages for latent class analysis since you have previous experience with this technique. She also recommended creating interactive elements using shiny, shinydashboard, and plotly to allow users to dynamically select variables and adjust model parameters."

However, this dataset requires a lot of encoding and might be more suitable for machine learning. \nJia Rong suggested using the Seoul Bike Sharing Demand dataset and conducting EDA and a prediction model on it. However, the dataset is a bit old (2017–2018). \nXiaohan mentioned that the global traffic accident dataset could be used, but Jia Rong thinks that the dataset has too few feature columns. However, Peng-wei and Xiaohan believe that this dataset is more suitable for visualization as it includes latitude and longitude information. \nIn the end, all three agreed to choose the Seoul bicycle dataset and the global traffic accident dataset as alternatives and will consult the professor later."

The team agreed and decided to not focus on geospatial visualizations. Peng Wei also suggested using Canva to draw out the storyboard."
